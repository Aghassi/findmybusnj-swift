# FIND MY BUS NJ
An app for tracking NJ Transit bus times.

## Version: 2.0
TODO:
- Migrate old version to a totally rewritten app in Swift
- Use cards that show bus and expected arrival, tapping on them should callout to the Maps and show the transit mode that shows the user the way the bus will take, and how long it may take to get there.
- Use Google's map API to return all bus stops and overlay them ontop of mapkit based on User's location

Future Updates:
- Add watch app (native)
